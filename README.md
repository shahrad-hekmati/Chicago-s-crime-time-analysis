# Chicago-s-crimes-time

In this project, I searched for time patterns in the Chicago crimes dataset witch gathered by the Chicago police division since 2001 and they update it every day it was also a big data project With high potential for more data mining witch I'll do in the future on a different point of views.  as I mentioned this project contains graphs and  bar plots and all of them have focused on the time
